      <description>Previous investigations of Floquet states in solid state samples have been mostly based on ultrafast light excitations.

      <description>The authors theoretically study superconductors that are terminated by a first-order phase transition to a correlated phase of different symmetry, referred to as the false vacuum. They propose that quenching across this transition leads to a nonequilibrium ephemeral superconductor, detectable with simple transport probes.</description>

      <description>Magneto-ionics are a promising approach for controlling magnetism via electric fields, but most studies have been limited to thin films, rather than the nanostructures that would form the basis of a magneto-ionic memory unit. Here, Spasojevic et al demonstrate magneto-ionic control over transitions among paramagnetic, single domain, and vortex states in an array of nanodots.</description>

      <description>On-surface synthesis of two-dimensional polymers is a useful strategy for designing the lattice, orbital and spin symmetries of materials, but controlling their layer stacking remains challenging. Now, a method to synthesize bilayer two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks at a liquid–substrate interface through monomer condensation has been developed; large-area moiré superlattices emerge from the twisted bilayer stacking.</description>

      <description>The Mpemba effect is an archetype for various anomalous relaxation phenomena. Here, the authors experimentally study a quantum version of the Mpemba effect in a single trapped ion system, where relaxation is exponentially accelerated by removing the excitation of the slowest decaying mode. This phenomenon, seen in Markovian open quantum systems containing Liouvillian exceptional points, indicates a link between the Mpemba effect and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <description>The microscopic pairing mechanism in high-temperature superconductors remains debated. Here, the authors offer a new perspective on this problem by proposing that the strong pairing in Fermi-Hubbard type models relevant to cuprates is driven by a Feshbach resonance, which enhances interactions between doped holes.</description>

      <description>β-PdBi2 superconducting properties have been known about since the 1950s, with various works since then indicating the possibility of multiple superconducting gaps and unconventional superconductivity. However, so far only a single gap s-wave superconductivity was detected. Here, using tunnelling spectroscopy under an applied magnetic field, Powell et al observe a transition from s-wave to nodal pairing.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55433-1</link>
      <description>Some chiral molecules can produce a giant spin polarization, a feature termed chirality-induced spin selectivity. The origin of this has been hotly debated. In this theory work, Zhao, Zhang and coauthors propose that the origin of the effect lies in charge trapping induced barrier modification, termed magnetochiral charge pumping.</description>

      <title>Alkali cation-π interactions in aqueous systems, modulating supramolecular stereoisomerism of nanoscopic metal-organic capsules</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54426-4</link>
      <description>Contrary to common chemical intuition, cation-π interactions can persist in polar, aqueous reaction solutions, rather than in dry non-coordinative solvent systems. Here, the authors highlight how alkali ion-π interactions impart distinctive structure-influencing supramolecular forces that can be exploited in the preparation of nanoscopic metal-organic capsules.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54525-2</link>
      <description>There has been substantial interest in realizing topological superconductivity, with various systems being considered as potential hosts. Heterostructures such as CrBr3/NbSe2 are one example. Here, Li and coauthors show, via scanning tunnelling microscope measurements, that signatures hitherto associated with topological superconductivity in CrBr3/NbSe2 are consistent with a topologically trivial superconductor.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54008-4</link>
      <description>Exsolved metal nanoparticles are widely believed to exhibit an exceptional robustness against coarsening. Here, the authors demonstrate that the coarsening behavior depends on the surface defect chemistry of the respective oxide support as well as the oxophilicity of the exsolved metal.</description>

      <title>Tunable multistate field-free switching and ratchet effect by spin-orbit torque in canted ferrimagnetic alloy</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52834-0</link>
      <description>Ferrimagnets contain two magnetic atoms with different magnetizations, and exhibit many features of antiferromagnets, however, they still retain a net magnetic moment, like ferromagnets. Here, Hsu et al make use of this combination of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnet properties to demonstrate a diverse array of magnetic switching phenomena in ferrimagnetic GdCo thin films that have previously only been observed in antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic bilayers.</description>

      <title>Rejuvenating liquid crystal elastomers for self-growth</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51544-x</link>
      <description>To date, only one polymer can self grow to an extended length beyond its original size at room temperature without external stimuli or energy input paving the way for significant advancements in untethered autonomous soft robotics but only freshly prepared samples in an initial state can self-grow. Here, the authors propose a strategy to rejuvenate non-fresh samples to their initial state for on demand self-growth through the synergistic effects of solvents and dynamic covalent bonds during swelling.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51072-8</link>
      <description>In α-helical folded peptides, the sequential repetition of amino acids generates a chiral layer defined by the amino acid side chains projected outside the amide backbone, and a general exo-helical symmetry model has not been described for the α-helix. Here, the authors introduce the exo-helical symmetry model of the α-helix that results from sequential repetition of amino acid residues and validate the topologies by computational methods and circular dichroism.</description>

      <description>Realising scalable entangled photon sources with quantum dots requires compensating for both wavelength mismatches and exciton fine-structure splitting (FSS). So far, multiple QDs with the same emission wavelength and near-zero FSS have not been demonstrated. Here, the authors fill this gap, reaching high entanglement fidelity for multiple QDs tuned into resonance with each other or with Rb atoms.</description>

      <description>Constructing artificial structures that can imitate complex topological transformation with sophisticated functions is challenging. Now, using topological operations involving ‘glue–cut’ processes, the global conformational change of topology-programmed DNA origami has been demonstrated. The reconfigurable DNA origami system developed here can encode signal propagation at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Formylation boosts the performance of light-driven overcrowded alkene-derived rotary molecular motors</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-024-01521-0</link>
      <description>Overcrowded alkene-derived molecular motors convert light and heat into chirality-directed unidirectional rotary motion, but the efficiency of their photochemical isomerization remains limited. Now formylation of the motor core has been shown to boost all aspects of motor photochemistry by improving photochemical efficiency, diminishing competing processes and redshifting absorption.</description>

      <description>The selective synthesis of ultrahigh-molar-mass (UHMM) cyclic polymers from direct polymerization is elusive. Using a chemically recyclable polythioester as a model, it has now been shown that a common superbase mediates living linear-chain growth, followed by proton-triggered linear-to-cyclic topological transformation, producing UHMM cyclic polymers with a narrow dispersity.</description>

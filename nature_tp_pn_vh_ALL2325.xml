      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-025-01748-5</link>
      <description>On-surface synthesis of two-dimensional polymers is a useful strategy for designing the lattice, orbital and spin symmetries of materials, but controlling their layer stacking remains challenging. Now, a method to synthesize bilayer two-dimensional covalent organic frameworks at a liquid–substrate interface through monomer condensation has been developed; large-area moiré superlattices emerge from the twisted bilayer stacking.</description>

      <description>The Mpemba effect is an archetype for various anomalous relaxation phenomena. Here, the authors experimentally study a quantum version of the Mpemba effect in a single trapped ion system, where relaxation is exponentially accelerated by removing the excitation of the slowest decaying mode. This phenomenon, seen in Markovian open quantum systems containing Liouvillian exceptional points, indicates a link between the Mpemba effect and non-Hermitian physics.</description>

      <title>Feshbach hypothesis of high-Tc superconductivity in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55549-4</link>
      <description>The microscopic pairing mechanism in high-temperature superconductors remains debated. Here, the authors offer a new perspective on this problem by proposing that the strong pairing in Fermi-Hubbard type models relevant to cuprates is driven by a Feshbach resonance, which enhances interactions between doped holes.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54867-x</link>
      <description>β-PdBi2 superconducting properties have been known about since the 1950s, with various works since then indicating the possibility of multiple superconducting gaps and unconventional superconductivity. However, so far only a single gap s-wave superconductivity was detected. Here, using tunnelling spectroscopy under an applied magnetic field, Powell et al observe a transition from s-wave to nodal pairing.</description>

      <title>Learning protocols for the fast and efficient control of active matter</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52878-2</link>
      <description>Exact analytic calculation shows that optimal control protocols for passive molecular systems often involve rapid variations and discontinuities. However, similar analytic baselines are not generally available for active-matter systems, because it is more difficult to treat active systems exactly. Here, the authors use machine learning to derive efficient control protocols for active-matter systems, and find that they are characterized by sharp features similar to those seen in passive systems.</description>

      <title>Exo-chirality of the α-helix</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-51072-8</link>
      <description>In α-helical folded peptides, the sequential repetition of amino acids generates a chiral layer defined by the amino acid side chains projected outside the amide backbone, and a general exo-helical symmetry model has not been described for the α-helix. Here, the authors introduce the exo-helical symmetry model of the α-helix that results from sequential repetition of amino acid residues and validate the topologies by computational methods and circular dichroism.</description>

      <description>The recently-developed topological heavy fermion model explains the low energy electrons of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene as a hybridization between states localized at AA stacking sites and itinerant topological states, denoted by f and c electrons in analogy to heavy fermion systems. Here, the authors extend this model to a nonzero magnetic field, obtaining interacting Hofstadter spectra in the flatband limit by analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Emergent flat band and topological Kondo semimetal driven by orbital-selective correlations</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-49306-w</link>
      <description>Flat electronic bands can give rise to correlation-driven phases but for this, they need to be tuned to the Fermi level. Here the authors predict flat bands pinned at the Fermi level due to orbital-selective interactions and discuss implications for the design of topological Kondo semimetal in d-electron systems.</description>

      <description>There are now several van der Waals magnets that have been shown to host skyrmions, however, these are typically hampered by a low Curie temperature, restricting the temperature at which the skyrmions can exist. Here, Zhang, Jiang, Jiang and coauthors find a skyrmion lattice in the van der Waals magnet Fe3 − xGaTe2 above room temperature and demonstrate the critical role of symmetry breaking in crystal lattice in the origin of these skyrmions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast all-optical toggle writing of magnetic bits without relying on heat</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-48438-3</link>
      <description>Toggle switching refers to the switching of magnetization induced by a train of ultrashort laser pulses. The high speed make such switching in extremely promising for devices, however, the underlying toggle switching mechanism in metals is due to heating, and thus has a downside of dissipation. Here, Zalewski et al demonstrate ultrafast ‘cold’ toggle switching, with a mechanism that does not rely on heating in dielectric Cobalt doped Yittrium Iron Garnet.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-47823-2</link>
      <description>In most materials, the hall conductivity has a scaling to the longitudinal resistance that varies between linear and quadratic. Here, Zhang et al demonstrate a hall conductivity proportional to the fifth power of the longitudinal conductivity in Mn3Si2Te6, which they attribute to enhanced force on charge carriers due to chiral orbital currents.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-46520-4</link>
      <description>Earlier research has shown that controlling activity in the active matter can lead to either a phase change or a laminar-turbulent transition in active fluids. Authors demonstrate that it is possible to control both the phase transitions between solid, liquid, and gas states and the laminar-to-turbulent transitions in fluid phases by adjusting the activity of a phoretic medium.</description>

      <title>Field-induced compensation of magnetic exchange as the possible origin of reentrant superconductivity in UTe2</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-44183-1</link>
      <description>The superconductor UTe2 exhibits a reentrant superconducting phase at magnetic fields above 40 T for particular field angles. Here, from high-field Hall-effect measurements, T. Helm et al. find evidence for a partial compensation between the applied field and an exchange field, pointing to the Jaccarino-Peter effect as a possible mechanism for the reentrant superconductivity.</description>

      <description>Polymers typically exhibit rheology with multiple relaxation times to fully capture stress relaxation processes to terminal flow. Here, the authors use inverse vulcanization to synthesize polymers that exhibit a single relaxation time due to dynamic covalent disulfide bond reorganization that dominate the rheological properties of these materials.</description>

      <description>Current approaches to distinguish topological phases from topologically-trivial phases have limited general applicability. Here, in a photonic-crystal context, the authors demonstrate that in trivial structures the bulk local density of states (LDOS) extends all the way to the edges and corners, while in topological structures the bulk LDOS actually avoids the edges and corners.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42426-9</link>
      <description>When two magnetic layers are separated by a metallic spacer, an interlayer exchange coupling can occur. Recently, it has been shown that interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions can also occur, driving chiral spin canting in the magnetic layers. Here, Arregi et al. demonstrate a large interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in Co/Ag/Co multilayers, which occurs despite the weak atomic spin-orbit coupling of the Ag spacer layer.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic resistance with a 90° twist in a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal, Co2MnGa</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-42222-5</link>
      <description>Weyl semimetals exhibit a rich variety of transport phenomena, but it usually takes low temperatures and a strong magnetic field to realize them. Here, Quirk et al. show that when the ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co2MnGa is polished to micron thicknesses, it develops a remarkable resistance anisotropy that has opposite directions on opposing crystal faces. They show that this unusual transport property, which is robust at room temperature and in a strong magnetic field, may be generated by distinct conducting states on the surfaces of these thin crystals.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of topological magnon polarons in a multiferroic material</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-41791-9</link>
      <description>A magnetic crystal hosts both magnons, the quanta of spin waves, and phonons, the quanta of lattice vibrations. In some materials with strong coupling between spins and lattices, a magnon-polaron can form. Here, using neutron scattering on a multiferroic, Fe2Mo3O8, Bao et al. observe magnon-polaron, and show that it is topologically non-trivial.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-023-01334-7</link>
      <description>Covalent organic frameworks offer a highly tunable class of materials for a range of applications, although their dynamic structural transformations are challenging to analyse. Now single-crystal X-ray diffraction is shown to demonstrate single-crystal-to-single-crystal transformations of the imine linkages, showing a well-defined interpenetrating topology and affording structures that have high positive thermal expansion and anhydrous proton-conduction properties.</description>

      <description>Graphene has many intriguing electronic properties. One of note is the absence of backscattering of electrons confined to a single valley. Spin-orbit interactions can allow backscattering, and here, Sun et al. use this spin-orbit coupling dependence of backscattering to measure the strength of the spin-orbit interaction in a graphene/tungsten selenide heterostructure.</description>

      <description>Kosterlitz–Thouless–Halperin–Nelson–Young (KTHNY) theory describes the melting of an ordered two-dimensional phase to a disordered phase, via a quasi-ordered ‘hexatic’ phase. Magnetic skyrmions, as a phase of two-dimensional quasi-particles may be expected to exhibit a KTHNY melting process, however, observing such a phase transition is difficult. Herein, Meisenheimer et al study the formation of magnetic skyrmions in (Fe0.5Co0.5)5GeTe2, and, via physical confinement at device scale, succeed in obtaining an ordered skrymion phase.</description>

      <description>The direction of polariton canalization—its diffractionless propagation—in twisted bilayers at the magic angle is hindered by the lack of multiple magic angles. By controlling the twist angles between three α-MoO3 layers, reconfigurable and spectrally robust polariton canalization along any in-plane direction is demonstrated.</description>

So far, the skyrmions that have been reported correspond to topological textures of magnetic dipole moments. Zhang et al show theoretically that quantum effects can lead to a distinct type of skyrmion that combines dipolar and quadrupolar moments, proposing a variety of materials, including magnets and quantum paramagnets, where such textures can be stabilized.</description>

      <description>Thermoelectric effects can be used to convert waste heat into electricity. One particularly promising thermoelectric mechanism is the spin Seebeck effect as the transverse geometry is ideal for device integration, even if currently it lacks sufficient thermoelectric conversion efficiency. Here, Kim et al, tackle this limitation, showing that oxidizing the ferromagnet layer used in the spin Seebeck effect can significantly enhance the thermoelectric efficiency.</description>

      <description>Catenanes are topologically non-trivial and, perhaps for this reason, molecules composed of two oriented rings have always simply been referred to as ‘topologically chiral’. Now it has been shown that the same stereogenic unit can arise in systems whose stereochemistry is Euclidean, suggesting a need to rethink this fundamental form of mechanical chirality.</description>

      <description>A central goal of spintronics is electric control of magnetism. One particularly promising method makes use of spin-orbit torques which arise due to the combination of electric current, and the intrinsic spin-orbit effect in a material.

      <title>Hybrid magnonics in hybrid perovskite antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-37505-w</link>
      <description>Recently there has been interest in exploring the coupling between magnons for use in information processing, however, this is hampered by the fact that such coupling is forbidden due to the different parity of the acoustic and optical magnons. Here, Comstock et al show that the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya-Interaction in a layered hybrid antiferromagnet can allow for strong coupling between the acoustic and optical magnons, offering a pathway for magnon coherent information processing.</description>

      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-36201-z</link>
      <description>Magnet/superconductor hybrids have been explored for the realization of topological superconductivity but have mainly focused on ferromagnets with full gaps. Here, the authors find that the antiferromagnet/superconductor heterostructure of monolayer Mn on a Nb(110) surface is a topological nodal-point superconductor.</description>

Here the authors show that the shortest paths are geometrically localized in hyperbolic representations of networks, and can be detected even if the large amount of network links are missing. The authors demonstrate the utility of geometric pathfinding in Internet routing and the reconstruction of cellular pathways.</description>

      <title>Active template strategy for the preparation of π-conjugated interlocked nanocarbons</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-022-01106-9</link>
      <description>An active-template approach has been used to prepare π-conjugated interlocked nanocarbons derived from [n]cycloparaphenylenes. A metal ion bound within the central cavity of a precursor macrocycle first catalyses cross-coupling reactions and then the resulting mechanically interlocked intermediates are further transformed into π-conjugated species—[2] and [3]catenanes as well as a conjugated [3]rotaxane.</description>

      <title>Tunable unconventional kagome superconductivity in charge ordered RbV3Sb5 and KV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35718-z</link>
      <description>The nature of the superconductivity in the kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) remains under debate. Here, using muon spin spectroscopy, the authors find that the superconductivity in RbV3Sb5 and KV3Sb5 evolves from nodal to nodeless with increasing pressure and the superconducting state breaks time-reversal symmetry after suppression of the charge order.</description>

      <title>Revealing the relationship between liquid fragility and medium-range order in silicate glasses</title>
      <link>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-35711-6</link>
      <description>Fragility describes the sharpness of dynamical arrest of a melt at its glass transition, yet its structural origin remains elusive. Shi et al. show that fragility inversely correlates with the medium-range order structure characterized by a measurable parameter named the average medium-range distance.</description>
